## Java Arrays

## Introduction

```
public class Newsfeed {
  
  String[] trendingArticles;
  int[] views;
  double[] ratings;
  
  public Newsfeed(String[] initialArticles, int[] initialViews, double[] initialRatings){
    trendingArticles = initialArticles;
    views = initialViews;
    ratings = initialRatings;
  }
  
  public String getTopArticle(){
    return trendingArticles[0];
  }
  
  public void viewArticle(int articleNumber){
    views[articleNumber] = views[articleNumber] + 1;
    System.out.println("The article '" + trendingArticles[articleNumber] + "' has now been viewed " + views[articleNumber] + " times!");
  }
  
  public void changeRating(int articleNumber, double newRating){
    if (newRating > 5 || newRating < 0) {
      System.out.println("The rating must be between 0 and 5 stars!");
    } else {
      ratings[articleNumber] = newRating;
      System.out.println("The article '" + trendingArticles[articleNumber] + "' is now rated " + ratings[articleNumber] + " stars!");
    }
  }
  
  public static void main(String[] args){
    String[] robotArticles = {"Oil News", "Innovative Motors", "Humans: Exterminate Or Not?", "Organic Eye Implants", "Path Finding in an Unknown World"};
    int[] robotViewers = {87, 32, 13, 11, 7};
    double[] robotRatings = {2.5, 3.2, 5.0, 1.7, 4.3};
    Newsfeed robotTimes = new Newsfeed(robotArticles, robotViewers, robotRatings);
    
    robotTimes.viewArticle(2);
    robotTimes.viewArticle(2);
    System.out.println("The top article is " + robotTimes.getTopArticle());
    robotTimes.changeRating(3, 5);
  }
}
```

1. In **Newsfeed.java**, we have created a `Newsfeed` class to keep track of trending articles and their associated views and ratings. We did this using Java arrays, which youâ€™ll learn about throughout the lesson!

    For now, run the code to see some of our method calls.

## Creating an Array Explicitly

```
public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
  
  // Create getTopics() below:
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    /*
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
    */
  }
}
```

1. We have an empty Newsfeed class that does not store anything yet.

    First, make a method called getTopics(), which:

* is public
* returns a String array
* does not take any parameters
* For now, leave the method empty.

2. Inside the getTopics() method, create a String array called topics and set it equal to an array containing these elements, in order:

```
Opinion
Tech
Science
Health
```

* Then, return topics from the method!

3. Uncomment the lines in the main method to see how the `getTopics()` method works on a `Newsfeed` instance.

## Importing Arrays

```
// import the Arrays package here:

public class Newsfeed {
  
  
  public Newsfeed(){
    
  }
    
  public String[] getTopics(){
    String[] topics = {"Opinion", "Tech", "Science", "Health"};
    return topics;
  }
  

  public static void main(String[] args){
    Newsfeed sampleFeed = new Newsfeed();
    String[] topics = sampleFeed.getTopics();
    System.out.println(topics);
  }
}
```

1. In order to make our printout of the `topics` array more helpful, we are going to want to use the `toString()` method from the `Arrays` package.

    To use it, we first must import the `Arrays` package from `java.util`. Import the package at the top of the **Newsfeed.java** file.

2. Now that you have the Arrays package, use its `toString()` method to print out the topics array in the `main()` method.
